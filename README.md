### 🚀 Software Developer | Focus on Robust Backend & Desktop Solutions

I am a software developer committed to building robust and efficient systems. After gaining experience in full-stack logic, I decided to specialize in **strongly-typed languages** and **backend architecture**, where I can focus on data integrity and performance.
